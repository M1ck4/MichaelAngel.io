# MichaelAngel.io

Welcome to **MichaelAngel.io**, a visionary project dedicated to merging the realms of generative AI and artistic expression. Our mission is to empower artists with innovative tools that inspire creativity while championing transparency and ethical practices in the digital landscape.

## Overview

**MichaelAngel.io** is designed to elevate artistic creation through the application of generative AI technologies. We believe that these tools can not only enhance the creative process but also cultivate collaboration among artists. Our commitment to legal and ethical standards is unwavering, as we strive to nurture a community where creativity flourishes without compromising artistic integrity.

## Creative Commons Commitment

At the heart of our project lies a profound respect for **Creative Commons** principles. By utilizing materials that are publicly accessible and legally compliant, we aim to democratize art and knowledge. We believe that sharing resources enriches the creative ecosystem and allows artists to draw inspiration from each other while maintaining their rights.

### Ethical Practices

We recognize the importance of ethics in the age of AI. Our platform is built on the foundation of:

- **Respect for Artists**: We prioritize attribution and ensure that creators are acknowledged for their contributions. Our system automatically pulls attribution information when necessary, reinforcing our commitment to honoring artistic labor.
  
- **Transparency**: We aim to provide clear guidelines and documentation, enabling artists to understand the tools they are using and how their work is being impacted. 

- **Community Empowerment**: By fostering an inclusive environment, we invite artists from all backgrounds to engage, collaborate, and contribute to the project.

## Application Development

#### Curator 
This downloader tool is designed to gather Creative Commons images from various API sources. By enabling artists to collect and organize images effortlessly, Curator serves as the first step in the creative pipeline.

#### Chisel 
Acting as the preprocessing stage, Chisel ensures that images meet quality and size requirements. It removes duplicates, checks for blurriness, and prepares the images for the next phase, emphasizing the importance of high-quality data for successful artistic outcomes.

#### FilmFrame
Extracts frames from Creative Commons licensed movies, providing artists and researchers with a rich resource for creative projects. Its highlights the artistry of cinematic storytelling while ensuring proper attribution through automated metadata tagging. Ideal for non-profit and educational use, FilmFrame bridges the gap between film and AI-driven creativity, inspiring new possibilities in visual expression.

#### Muse 
The dataset creator and manager, Muse organizes the preprocessed images into structured datasets ready for training. It allows for dataset splitting, labeling, and augmentation, providing artists with the tools needed to enhance their creative projects.

#### MichaelAngelo .io 
The main generative model, MichaelAngelo, is designed to create new images based on the datasets prepared by Muse. This tool embodies the culmination of our efforts to merge AI and art, allowing for innovative artistic expression.
