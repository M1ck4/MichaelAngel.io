- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors processing steps and augmentation progress.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for auditing and troubleshooting.

## AI Pipeline Overview

Muse is part of a comprehensive AI pipeline for creating ethical and high-quality datasets using Creative Commons images. The pipeline includes:

1. **Curator (Downloader)**
   - Downloads Creative Commons images from various APIs based on defined search terms or categories.
   - Extracts and manages metadata, ensuring images meet basic requirements.

2. **A. FilmFrame (Frame Extractor)**
   - Extracts frames from movie files and generates associated metadata.

3. **Chisel (Preprocessor)**
   - Resizes images, removes blurry or corrupted files, and standardizes the dataset.

4. **Muse (Dataset Creator and Manager)**
   - Organizes, labels, augments, and optimizes the dataset for AI model training.

5. **MichaelAngelo (Main AI Model)**
   - Trains the generative model using the prepared dataset.

### Alternate Workflow

- **Musing After Curator**: Quickly manage new datasets by running Muse right after Curator. However, it's recommended to run Chisel first to ensure data quality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 - 3.10**: TensorFlow and other dependencies require Python versions 3.8 to 3.10.
- **pip**: Ensure `pip` is up to date.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/muse.git
   
        cd muse
   
### Usage

Muse is designed to be used after Chisel has preprocessed the images. Follow these steps to create and manage your dataset:
Command-Line Arguments

    python muse.py \
    --input_folder path/to/preprocessed_images \
    --output_folder path/to/output_dataset \
    --split_ratios 0.7 0.2 0.1 \
    --augment \
    --augmentation_types rotate flip_horizontal mixup cutmix \
    --augmentation_multiplier 2 \
    --min_size 256 \
    --allowed_formats JPEG PNG \
    --stratify

### Parameters

    --input_folder: Path to the folder containing preprocessed images and their metadata from Chisel.
    --output_folder: Destination folder where the organized dataset will be saved.
    --split_ratios: Ratios for splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Must sum to 1.0. Default is 0.8 0.1 0.1.
    --augment: Enable data augmentation.
    --augmentation_types: Types of augmentations to apply. Options include rotate, flip_horizontal, flip_vertical, crop, mixup, cutmix.
    --augmentation_multiplier: Number of times to apply augmentation per image. Default is 1.
    --min_size: Minimum image size (in pixels) for quality control. Images smaller than this will be excluded. Default is 128.
    --allowed_formats: List of allowed image formats. Default is JPEG PNG.
    --stratify: Enable stratified splitting based on labels to maintain class distribution.

### Examples

    python muse.py \
    --input_folder ./preprocessed_images \
    --output_folder ./dataset \
    --split_ratios 0.7 0.2 0.1 \
    --augment \
    --augmentation_types rotate flip_horizontal mixup cutmix \
    --augmentation_multiplier 2 \
    --min_size 256 \
    --allowed_formats JPEG PNG \
    --stratify

### Steps

Load Metadata: Muse loads metadata from JSON files generated by Curator, Chisel, and FilmFrame.
Quality Control: Filters out images that do not meet the minimum size or are in unsupported formats.
Apply Labels: Labels images based on metadata categories.
Split Dataset: Divides the dataset into training, validation, and test sets according to specified ratios.
Data Augmentation: Applies specified augmentation techniques to diversify the training data.
Analyze Dataset: Generates analytics on dataset composition.
Export Dataset: Saves the organized dataset into designated folders with updated metadata.

Configuration
Label Mapping

The label_mapping dictionary in the script maps category names to numerical labels. Modify this dictionary in the script to match your dataset's categories.

    label_mapping = {
    'Category1': 0,
    'Category2': 1,
    'Unknown': -1
    }

### Augmentation Types

Available augmentation types:

    rotate: Rotates images by 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
    flip_horizontal: Flips images horizontally.
    flip_vertical: Flips images vertically.
    crop: Crops the central portion of the image.
    mixup: Blends two images together.
    cutmix: Combines parts of two images.

### Quality Control

Muse ensures data quality by performing the following checks:

    Format Verification: Ensures images are in allowed formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
    Size Verification: Excludes images below the minimum size threshold.
    Metadata Integrity: Validates that metadata files are correctly linked and include necessary information like Creative Commons attribution.

### Performance Optimization

To handle large datasets efficiently, Muse utilizes:

    Multiprocessing: Accelerates data augmentation by processing multiple images in parallel.
    Progress Indicators: Uses tqdm to display progress bars during processing steps.
    Resource Management: Optimizes memory and CPU usage to handle extensive datasets without significant slowdowns.

### Dataset Management

Muse ensures your dataset is well-organized and balanced:

Balanced Splits: Maintains representative distributions across training, validation, and test sets.

Stratified Splitting: Preserves label distributions to prevent biases in model training.

Incremental Updates: Facilitates easy updates and maintenance of the dataset as new images are added.

### Analytics & Monitoring

Muse provides valuable insights into your dataset:

Dataset Analytics: Logs total images and label distributions for each split.

Processing Logs: Detailed logs (muse_log.txt) record processing steps, errors, and augmentation details.

Transparency: Records processing steps applied to each image for auditing and compliance.
