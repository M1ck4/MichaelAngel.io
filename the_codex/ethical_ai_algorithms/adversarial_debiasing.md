# Adversarial Debiasing for AI Fairness

## Overview

**Adversarial Debiasing** is a preprocessing technique designed to promote fairness in classifiers by employing adversarial techniques. This approach aims to maximize prediction accuracy while reducing the influence of protected attributes (e.g., race, gender) on model predictions. By using an adversarial model to detect and mitigate evidence of protected attributes in the classifier, Adversarial Debiasing enables more equitable outcomes. This technique is part of IBM's **AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)** toolkit, a library dedicated to building ethically sound AI systems.

## Objective

The main objectives of the **Adversarial Debiasing** technique are:

- **Accuracy and Fairness Balance**: Preserving the classifier's accuracy while reducing bias in predictions.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Actively minimizing the influence of protected attributes on model outcomes.
- **Classifier Fairness**: Making classifiers fairer by transforming the data before or during training.

## How Adversarial Debiasing Works

Adversarial Debiasing incorporates a two-model approach: a primary model and an adversary. The primary model attempts to predict the target variable as accurately as possible, while the adversary tries to predict the protected attribute from the primary model’s predictions. The adversarial model's feedback helps modify the primary model to prevent it from relying on sensitive attributes, thereby reducing bias.

### Key Components and Classes

- **`AdversarialDebiasing` Class**: This class implements the Adversarial Debiasing algorithm, adjusting model parameters to balance fairness and accuracy.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `unprivileged_groups` and `privileged_groups`: Definitions for protected groups.
    - `scope_name`: Scope for managing model variables.
    - `sess`: TensorFlow session.
    - `debias`: Boolean flag to indicate if debiasing should be applied.

### Code Structure and Methods

- **`fit`**: Trains the adversarial model to reduce bias in predictions by adjusting model parameters.
- **`predict`**: Predicts the target variable while incorporating adjustments to maintain fairness.

## Code Example

The following code demonstrates how to apply **Adversarial Debiasing** using `AdversarialDebiasing` on a dataset.

### Requirements

Install the AI Fairness 360 package:

```
pip install aif360
```

### Implementation

```
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from aif360.algorithms.inprocessing import AdversarialDebiasing
from aif360.datasets import BinaryLabelDataset

# Define privileged and unprivileged groups
privileged_groups = [{'race': 1}]  # Privileged group definition
unprivileged_groups = [{'race': 0}]  # Unprivileged group definition

# Load your dataset (example using BinaryLabelDataset)
dataset = BinaryLabelDataset(...)

# Create a TensorFlow session
sess = tf.Session()

# Initialize Adversarial Debiasing model with specified parameters
adv_debiasing = AdversarialDebiasing(privileged_groups=privileged_groups,
                                     unprivileged_groups=unprivileged_groups,
                                     scope_name='debiasing',
                                     sess=sess,
                                     debias=True)

# Fit the model to reduce bias
adv_debiasing.fit(dataset)

# Predict on a test dataset
predictions = adv_debiasing.predict(dataset)
```

### Explanation of Code Example

- **Privileged and Unprivileged Groups**: Define the protected attribute (e.g., "race") and specify privileged (e.g., `{'race': 1}`) and unprivileged groups (e.g., `{'race': 0}`).
- **TensorFlow Session**: Required for running the adversarial model within a session context.
- **Fit**: Trains the model using adversarial debiasing techniques to minimize reliance on protected attributes.
- **Predict**: Uses the debiased model to make predictions on new data.

## Detailed Steps for Using Adversarial Debiasing

1. **Define Privileged and Unprivileged Groups**:  
   Specify the attribute that separates privileged and unprivileged groups (e.g., "race", "gender").

2. **Initialize TensorFlow Session**:  
   Create a TensorFlow session to handle model training and prediction.

3. **Fit the Model**:  
   The `fit` method uses adversarial training to reduce bias in the classifier’s predictions.

4. **Make Predictions**:  
   Use the `predict` method to generate unbiased predictions for new data.

5. **Evaluate Results**:  
   Measure the fairness and accuracy metrics to assess the effect of adversarial debiasing on model predictions.

## Important Considerations

### Adversarial Training

Adversarial Debiasing relies on adversarial training to minimize the model’s dependency on protected attributes. The effectiveness of this method depends on careful tuning of model parameters to balance fairness with accuracy.

### TensorFlow Dependency

This implementation requires TensorFlow, as the adversarial model is trained within a TensorFlow session. Compatibility issues may arise with TensorFlow updates, so ensure your environment is properly configured.

## Example Application: UCI Adult Dataset

### Steps
1. **Load the Dataset**: Use the UCI Adult dataset or a similar dataset that includes protected attributes like race and gender.
2. **Apply Adversarial Debiasing**: Follow the code example to train the classifier using adversarial techniques.
3. **Evaluate Fairness**: Assess fairness and accuracy metrics across protected groups to verify the effect of adversarial debiasing.

Adversarial Debiasing is particularly useful in applications where reducing reliance on sensitive attributes is essential, as it actively removes bias from the model’s predictions.
