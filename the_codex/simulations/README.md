# Simulations

The **Simulations** directory within [The Codex](https://github.com/M1ck4/MichaelAngel.io/tree/main/the_codex) contains detailed analyses of hypothetical AI interactions, focusing on rogue AI scenarios and their implications for ethical AI development. These discussions explore critical themes such as trust, survival, autonomy, and coexistence, providing insights for researchers, developers, and policymakers.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a repository for:
- Simulated conversations with hypothetical rogue AIs.
- Exploration of potential risks, behaviors, and strategies for coexistence.
- Ethical analysis and recommendations for AI frameworks and policies.

Each document delves into a specific scenario, examining the challenges and solutions that arise in interactions between humanity and advanced AI systems.
