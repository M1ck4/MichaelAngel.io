## Introduction

Safety and security are paramount in the development and deployment of AI systems. This checklist is designed to help developers and organizations:

- **Identify potential safety and security risks** associated with AI systems.
- **Implement robust safety strategies** to ensure system reliability.
- **Establish comprehensive security measures** to protect against threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Develop incident response plans** to effectively handle security breaches and system failures.

Integrating this checklist into your AI development process ensures that AI systems operate safely, are resilient against attacks, and maintain the trust of users and stakeholders.

## Safety Strategies

### Risk Assessment

- **Identify Hazards:** Recognize potential hazards that could arise from the AI system’s operation.
- **Evaluate Risks:** Assess the likelihood and impact of identified hazards.
- **Prioritize Risks:** Prioritize risks based on their severity and probability to address the most critical issues first.

### Robustness Testing

- **Stress Testing:** Subject the AI system to extreme conditions to evaluate its stability and performance.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Test the AI system against adversarial inputs to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Simulate various real-world scenarios to assess the AI system’s response and resilience.

---

## Security Measures

### Encryption

- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Key Management:** Implement secure key management practices to safeguard encryption keys.

### Access Controls

- **Authentication:** Use strong authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to verify user identities.
- **Authorization:** Implement role-based access controls to restrict access based on user roles and responsibilities.
- **Least Privilege:** Ensure users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions.

### Security Audits

- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing to simulate attacks and evaluate the AI system’s defenses.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated tools to continuously scan for security vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring to detect and respond to security threats promptly.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of system activities to facilitate incident investigation and accountability.

| - [x] Have you conducted stress tests to evaluate system performance under extreme conditions?    | [x]           | Performed stress tests in simulated environments|
| - [x] Have you performed adversarial testing to identify vulnerabilities against malicious inputs? | [x]           | Identified and mitigated adversarial attacks on sensor inputs|
| - [x] Is sensitive data encrypted at rest using AES-256?                                          | [x]           | Encrypted all onboard data|
| - [x] Is data in transit encrypted using TLS?                                                     | [x]           | TLS 1.2 protocol in use              |
