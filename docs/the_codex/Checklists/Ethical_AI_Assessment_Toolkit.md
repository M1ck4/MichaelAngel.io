# Ethical Impact Assessment Toolkit for AI Systems

Developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers tremendous potential to drive innovation and solve complex problems. However, it also raises significant ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed to ensure responsible and fair use. This **Ethical Impact Assessment Toolkit** is designed to help developers systematically evaluate the ethical implications of their AI projects, ensuring they align with ethical standards and societal values.

## Introduction

Ethical Impact Assessments (EIAs) for AI systems are essential for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential ethical risks associated with AI deployment. This toolkit provides a structured approach for developers to:

- **Identify ethical considerations** relevant to their AI systems.
- **Evaluate the impact** of AI on various stakeholders.
- **Implement strategies** to address ethical challenges proactively.

By integrating this toolkit into the development lifecycle, developers can foster trust, ensure compliance with regulations, and promote the responsible use of AI technologies.

## Toolkit Components

The toolkit comprises six key ethical dimensions. For each dimension, a checklist of questions is provided to guide the assessment.

### 1. Data Privacy and Security

**Objective:** Ensure that data used and generated by the AI system is handled securely and respects user privacy.
