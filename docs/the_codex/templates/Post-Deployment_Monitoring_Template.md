# Post-Deployment Monitoring Template

## Introduction

This Post-Deployment Monitoring Template is designed to help AI developers and stakeholders systematically monitor the performance, ethical compliance, and impact of an AI system after it has been deployed. Monitoring helps ensure the AI system continues to operate ethically, effectively, and safely in a real-world environment.
