# FilmFrame (INCOMPLETE)

**FilmFrame** is a tool designed to extract frames from Creative Commons movies, creating training sets for generative AI models. This project operates under a non-profit mission, ensuring respect for the rights of original creators while enhancing the capabilities of AI through publicly available works.

## Overview

In an age where generative AI is revolutionizing the creative landscape, **FilmFrame** offers a unique way to harness the potential of film. By extracting frames from Creative Commons movies, we aim to provide high-quality training data that contributes to the development of AI models focused on creativity and artistic expression.

## Features

- **Frame Extraction**: Automatically extract frames from Creative Commons licensed movies.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple movies at once to streamline the frame extraction workflow.
- **Quality Control**: Ensure that extracted frames meet specific quality criteria, making them suitable for training AI models.
- **Metadata Collection**: Gather essential metadata for each frame, including licensing information, to ensure compliance and proper attribution.

## How It Works

1. **Input Movie Files**: Users provide a directory containing Creative Commons movie files.
2. **Extract Frames**: The tool processes each movie, extracting frames at specified intervals or conditions.
3. **Save Extracted Frames**: The extracted frames are stored in an organized directory structure, along with associated metadata.
4. **Ready for Training**: The frames can then be used as training data for generative AI models, enhancing their ability to learn from diverse visual content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (e.g., OpenCV, moviepy, etc.)
